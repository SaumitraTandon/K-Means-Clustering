# K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Means Clustering algorithm using Python & R. K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data points into distinct groups based on their similarities. This notebook contains all the steps needed to perform clustering on a dataset, from data preprocessing to visualization of the clusters.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to explore how K-Means clustering can be applied to a dataset to group data points into clusters. The notebook includes:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for clustering.
- **K-Means Implementation**: Applying the K-Means algorithm to find the optimal number of clusters.
- **Evaluation**: Using metrics like the elbow method to evaluate the quality of the clusters.
- **Visualization**: Plotting the results to visualize the clusters and their centroids.

## Installation

To run this notebook, you'll need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the required dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab installed to run the `.ipynb` file.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/k_means_clustering.git
   cd k_means_clustering
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook k_means_clustering.ipynb
   ```

4. Follow the steps in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, apply K-Means clustering, and visualize the results.

## Results

After running the notebook, you will obtain visualizations of the clustered data along with centroids for each cluster. The notebook also demonstrates how to interpret the elbow method to choose the optimal number of clusters.
